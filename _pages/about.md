**Mattia Piazza** is currently a Researcher and PhD student in the **Doctoral Program in Materials, Mechatronics and Systems Engineering ([DRMMSE](https://www.unitn.it/drmmse))** at **[Universit√† di Trento](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0221571/Didattica)**.
After receiving the high school diploma in 2013, he obtained a bachelor of science degree in **Mechanical Engineering** at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/it) in 2017 and he achieved a master of science degree in **Mechatronic Engineering** at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/it) in 2020. He was awarded with a post graduate scholarship first and then with a two-year research fellowship grant to expand his thesis research on minimum time optimal control problem for racing vehicles. In 2022, he enrolled in the PhD program where he is currently working on autonomous driving algorithm and Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) for racing and urban vehicles.
