title: "About Me"
---

**Mattia Piazza** is currently a Researcher and PhD student in the **Doctoral Program in Materials, Mechatronics and Systems Engineering ([DRMMSE](https://www.unitn.it/drmmse))** at the [University of Trento](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0221571/Didattica).
After receiving his high school diploma in 2013, he obtained a bachelor of science degree in **Mechanical Engineering** at the [University of Udine](https://www.uniud.it/it) in 2017, and he achieved a master of science degree in **Mechatronic Engineering** at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/it) in 2020. He was awarded with a postgraduate scholarship and then a two-year research fellowship grant to expand his thesis research on minimum time optimal control problem for racing vehicles. In 2022, he enrolled in the PhD program where he is currently working on autonomous driving algorithms and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) for racing and urban vehicles.

## Previous works
