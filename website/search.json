    "text": "Mattia Piazza is currently a Researcher and PhD student in the Doctoral Program in Materials, Mechatronics and Systems Engineering (DRMMSE) at the University of Trento. After receiving his high school diploma in 2013, he obtained a bachelor of science degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Udine in 2017, and he achieved a master of science degree in Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Trento in 2020. He was awarded with a postgraduate scholarship and then a two-year research fellowship grant to expand his thesis research on minimum time optimal control problem for racing vehicles. In 2022, he enrolled in the PhD program where he is currently working on autonomous driving algorithms and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) for racing and urban vehicles."
